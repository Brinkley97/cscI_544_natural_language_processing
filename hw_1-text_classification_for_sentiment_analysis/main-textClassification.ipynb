It scans to the usual formats: jpeg, tiff, PDF, png, etc. (Others too, but those are the ones I use most.)<br /><br />As a Mac users I've always just downloaded the Epson drivers when prompted, and in the case of the 320 setup was a breeze. Once setup, I could print from my Macbook Air over the network, and from my iPad directly to the printer. Both devices found the printer easily and there were no glitches. You can use a USB cable (not included), or print from an SD card, which is where the LCD comes in handy.<br /><br />This is a compact printer, paper feeds in from the top (pull up the little tray), and while it says it can hold 100 sheets I didn't load that many--I suspect it would get pretty tight.<br /><br />The printer comes with starter ink cartridges. Just enough to get you going. Of course, the printer is cheap and the ink will cost you, but of course that's been the economy of printers for the past ten years or so: low cost machine, but they make their money on the ink.
