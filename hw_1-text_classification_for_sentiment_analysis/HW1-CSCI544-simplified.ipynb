      "This cube (a variant of the Oskar's Gift Cube+) is a real win!  The cavity in the center was large enough to fit an engagement ring (protectively folded up in paper) and the top is a little tough to take off (which I consider a plus being that I didn't have to worry about it prematurely coming off when she solved that side).<br /><br />It does have a few negatives:<br />* It's a little tough to turn<br />* the colors are not in the same positions as a normal Rubik's cube<br />* while NOTHING DID, I was a little concerned about using a velvet bag or the like for the ring, for fear that it would get stuck in the grooves and jam up the cube.  This didn't happen, but I THINK it is a possibility.<br /><br />I still have to give it 5-stars, though.  After months trying to find Osakar's Gift Box in stock, this was ready and willing to be bought.  It came in promptly and in a neat box!  My girlfriend (who is now my fiancÃ©e) keeps cracking me up!
