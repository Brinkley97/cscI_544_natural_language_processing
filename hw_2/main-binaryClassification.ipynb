It does come with what appears to be a VGA adapter but umm hello..its 2011, I haven't had any laptop or other piece of electronics that has a VGA port in years, everything is HDMI and HDMI mini.<br /><br />I was successful in testing it out on my iPhone watching youtube videos but because I have a case on the phone, the adapter wouldn't fit properly and would pop out and then the signal would be lost. I had to hold the adapter in the iPhone to have it work wish is silly. The plug that the iPhone came with does NOT have this problem even when the case is on the phone and its one of those thin 2 piece shells.<br /><br />I wanted to test it out using my laptop but obviously it can't be done as this is really made for iPhone/ipads. I'll have to do some research to see if there's a plug that has regular HDMI and the super mini HDMI that fits this unit.<br /><br />As for the color, it was nice, nothing spectacular, reminded me of the movie theaters 20 minute projector stuff before the showing starts.
